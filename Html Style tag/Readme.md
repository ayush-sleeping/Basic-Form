# HTML-Style-tag
Here I have created a basic Web-Page üöß where I am using only Style tag to give design in Page, <br>
 ( Created this Basic Landing website Project, during my HTML Learning )
<br/>
<br/>

- The <style> ‚ö° tag is used to define style information (CSS) for a document.
- Inside the <style> element you specify how HTML elements should render in a browser.
  
  
## Objective and Requirements:
  
- Goal: Design a Webpage using "style" Tag
- Dev tools: &nbsp; <a href="#"><img alt="HTML" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML-E34F26.svg?logo=html5&logoColor=white"></a>
    * Using HTML ( Creating the structure üèóÔ∏è ) 
    
- Required: editor and browser
  
## Here I have created a basic "Landing Website" ,
- Since, I have not yet covered CSS (during this making), the style of development I use to build this page will not be the most efficient
- I'll be using inline style formatting which is considered outdated 
- Using only HTML, we're limited in certain respects when it comes to the format and layout of our page
- Aside from that I'll be employing many useful skills that will carry forward such as object insertion, text formatting form development and basic styling.
