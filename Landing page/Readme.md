# Home Landing WebPage
Created this Basic Home (Landing) website Project  üöß, during my HTML Learning 

## Objective and Requirements:
- Goal: Create simple and basic "Home Website"
- Dev tools: <a href="#"><img alt="HTML" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML-E34F26.svg?logo=html5&logoColor=white"></a>
- Required: editor and browser

## Here I have created a basic "Business Website" üèóÔ∏è,
- Since, I have not yet covered CSS (during this making), the style of development I use to build this page will not be the most efficient
- I'll be using inline style formatting which is considered outdated 
- Using only HTML, we're limited in certain respects when it comes to the format and layout of our page
- Aside from that I'll be employing many useful skills that will carry forward such as object insertion, text formatting form development and basic styling.
