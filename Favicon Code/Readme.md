## About Favicon: 

A favicon (short for favorite icon), also known as a shortcut icon, website icon, tab icon, URL icon, or bookmark icon, is a file containing one or more small icons,
associated with a particular website or web page. A web designer can create such an icon and upload it to a website (or web page) by several means, and graphical web 
browsers will then make use of it. Browsers that provide favicon support typically display a page's favicon in the browser's address bar (sometimes in the history as well)
and next to the page's name in a list of bookmarks. Browsers that support a tabbed document interface typically show a page's favicon next to the page's title on the tab,
and site-specific browsers use the favicon as a desktop icon.
